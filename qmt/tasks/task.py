"""
Core module of the Task framework. Contains the base Task class,
from which all special purpose tasks are subclassed.

How to use, in a nutshell:
    To create a new task, subclass Task.
    The constructor for the subclass must call the superclass constructor with \
        task_list=list of all dependent tasks, \
        options=dictionary containing all other inputs to the subclass task, \
        and optionally name=arbitrary name.
    These should also, in most cases, be the arguments to the subclass constructor--
    any arguments that the subclass constructor needs that are not dependent tasks should
    be placed into the options argument.
    See basic/geometry.py for an example.

    The actual work done by your Task subclass will be done in the _solve_instance callback,
    which you must implement.
    The _solve_instance callback expects two parameters:
    input_result_list and current_options.
    The input_result_list stores the outputs of the dependent tasks in the same order these tasks
    were given in the constructor, and current_options stores the options to the current task.

    There is also a _solve_gather callback for use in specialized situations.

    IMPORTANT: object references in both of these callback parameters must be treated as read-only
    or copied before modification,
    since they are shared across parameter sweeps.

    Both the input results and options
    may be dependent on an automatically-handled sweep. Your _solve_instance does not have to know about this--
    it just has to compute its result dependent on the outputs of dependent tasks and its options,
    and return this result.

    Finally, to run a task, use the run() method,
    which begins the actual calculation. run() returns immediately and stores pointers to the results undergoing
    computation in a SweepHolderFutures object in the .computed_result field of the task. This object
    associates sweep parameters with the results being computed. You can iterate over results being computed,
    wait for the results to be computed with calculate_completed_results(), or wait for any particular result
    with get_completed_result().

    For an example of how to set up a sweep, see ./tests/test_tasks_sweep.py and refer
    to the documentation of the sweeping classes in sweep.py.
